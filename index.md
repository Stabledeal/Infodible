## Welcome to GitHub Pages

This SEO tutorial teaches you a  <a href="https://infodible.in/update">“beat the leader”</a> approach to search engine ranking. It offers  <a href="https://www.seodly.com">SEO</a> tips that have worked for our digital marketing clients. To see what  <a href="https://stabledeal.in">Google</a> or <a href="https://infodible.in">Bing</a> thinks is best for any specific attribute, we look at the sites they are currently rewarding — the top-ranked results. Once you know what structural and content choices worked for the “leaders,” you can do even better by making your pages the “least imperfect”!

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/Stabledeal/Stabledeal/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Stabledeal/Stabledeal/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
